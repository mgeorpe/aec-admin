AEC Development Notes


## ALIGNMENT ##
Okay time to reflect back and realign.
What were the macro goals again? 
What have we achieved? 
What should be our micro steps? 

## COMMIT ##
Okay I guess its time to document them in github.
I need step by step guidance on proper folder/file naming, proper commit messages.
Also if applicable: changelog, readme, etc.


## ??? ##
Do we need to do sanity checks (structural validation, data integrity)? 
What did we forget or missed? 
What were the macro goals again? 
What should be our micro steps? 
Can I see an updated documentation please so I can commit it in my github for tracking? 
What should I put in the changelog?

Okay time to reflect back.
I am done with Local Setup in my macbook for about a day started yesterday since my Windows laptop is in repair center.

What have we achieved prior to my local macbook setup?
What were the macro goals? 

Ignore this questions if not applicable:
Do we need to do sanity checks (structural validation, data integrity)? 
What did we forget or missed? 
What should be our micro steps? 
Can I see an updated documentation please so I can commit it in my github for tracking? 
What should I put in the changelog?

When i ask for an alignment, wait for my confirmation before making your responses long, that is why it is called alignment. That way, me scrolling up will not be tedious.

Also, I already added this docs before I asked you the alignment question and break some of them down and added many more:
1 Initial Steps
2 Folder Structure
3 Git Workflows
AEC-Admin Local Setup Macbook
CHANGELOG.md
db-design.md

So..

Maybe we can add a changelog and the one liner link

Then maybe we can resume work for the sql stuff (placeholder only). I dont want to document DDL or any other sql script if we still working on them. Kinda pointless. I will say when to do them when I validated all of the sanity in DB and if we wire them in UI.

Then maybe we can resume the DB work.

What do you think?


-----------------------
-- Color Coding [git setup]
-----------------------
in my vscode, I think we make it look like homebew. how can i make my terminal such that my commands and outputs are easily distinguishable. For example if my command is green, the output should have a different color.


-----------------------
-- Annoying Passphrase [git setup]
-----------------------
i observed that everytime i push, it asked for passphrase.. kinda annoying, i thought setting up the ssh is one time and the agent auto runs every time i typed a passphrase

hey before you give  this  code "ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519"


-------------------------
-- Git Aliases [git setup]
-------------------------
i want aliases. some commands are too long
commit -> i want something like git cmt
status -> i want something like git st
i know we've setup something about fancy logline in another chat, can we do that here

I actually dont know what status guard on accounts_v2 is..
Lets say Ill say yes, can we do checks first. Because there might be some thing in place already right?

-- Behavior and Flow [webdev]
-----------------------
Couple of comments from your behavior

1. When we realign, one of the "next micro steps" was updated_at trigger. My comment here is you didnt include as of your steps to verify if the column exists. With all our conversation revolving around being careful and sanity, I am really disappointed. Please learn from this.

2. The way you write your steps is clunky. Why not try this approach. First we do the necessary database stuff + testing one at a time. After that stuff is done, then thats the only time you recommend if we are ready to document them in github. By approaching it this way, your responses will be shorter and we avoid long scroll ups every time we see an error. 

3. With all that being said, after you digested my #1 and #2 comments and gave proper responses. I want the clear instructions on how to document this in github. While file to create, where to create it, what content to paste, commit message, etc.

-------------------------
3. Rollup view
   Draft v_accounts_summary to simplify sanity + UI wiring.
4. Sanity query set
   Save the queries you already ran (nulls, dupes, mapping, domains, status logic, year bounds) into sql/sanity/ as reusable scripts.
5. Prepare seeds
   Minimal trusted seeds for accounts_v2 and account_contacts (idempotent inserts).
